        - **Income & Expense Overview Charts**: Line charts visualize your total income and expenses over the last 6 months, helping you identify trends.
        - **Expense Breakdown Chart**: A pie chart illustrates how your expenses are distributed across different categories for the current month.
        - **Net Savings Overview Chart**: This line chart shows your net savings (income minus expenses) over the past 6 months, with a reference line at zero to easily see if you're saving or overspending.

          - Date: When the transaction occurred.
          - Description: A brief note about the transaction (e.g., "Lunch with client", "Electricity Bill").
          - Category: Assign a category (e.g., "Food", "Utilities", "Salary"). This helps in tracking and budgeting.
          - Amount: The value of the transaction.
          - Type: Specify if it's 'Income' or 'Expense'.
        - **Viewing Transactions**: All your transactions are listed in a data table.
        - **Sorting & Filtering**:
          - Click on column headers (like 'Date' or 'Amount') to sort the table.
          - Use the search bar at the top to filter transactions by description, category, etc.
          - Click the 'Columns' button to show or hide specific columns in the table for a cleaner view.
        - **Editing & Deleting**: For each transaction in the table, click the three-dot menu icon ('MoreHorizontal') on the right to find options to 'Edit' or 'Delete' that transaction.

          - Category: The expense category you want to budget for (e.g., "Groceries", "Entertainment"). This should match categories you use for expense transactions.
          - Allocated Amount: The maximum amount you plan to spend for this category in the selected month (in your chosen currency).
          - Month: Select the year and month for which this budget applies.
        - **Understanding Budget Cards**: Each budget you create is displayed as a card:
          - Shows the category, allocated amount, how much you've spent so far, and the remaining balance.
          - A progress bar visually represents your spending against the budget.
        - **Automatic Spending Calculation**: The 'Spent' amount on each budget card is automatically calculated by summing up all expense transactions that match the budget's category and month.
        - **Visual Alerts**:
          - The progress bar changes color (e.g., to yellow or red) as you get closer to or exceed your budget.
          - An alert icon may appear if you're over budget.
        - **Editing & Deleting Budgets**: Each budget card has 'Edit' and 'Delete' icons, allowing you to modify or remove budget entries as needed.`,
